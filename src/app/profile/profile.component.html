				<p id="information">In the United States, renowned paleontologist and Jurassic Park survivor Dr. Alan Grant has made a new discovery on Velociraptors' intelligence, but struggles to secure funding for his research owing to another dinosaur-related incident at San Diego revealed the existences of the de-extinct zoological to the world. His former love and colleague, Dr. Ellie Sattler, has married a State Department employee named Mark and has two children after their break up following the first incident. Grant discusses with Sattler on his discovery of a resonating larynx on a fossilized raptor remains at Fort Peck Lake. This, in addition to his experience with the de-extinct animals at Jurassic Park, leads him to believe that the original Velociraptors were more sophisticated in socialization than humans' nonextant ancestors'. He hypothesizes that if the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event had not occur, their extant descendants would have become Earth's dominant species instead of humans. His assistant, Billy Brennan, uses a 3D printer to replicate the Velociraptor larynx to aid Grant's team's research.</p>
